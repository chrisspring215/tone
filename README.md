A synth in your web browser.

WARNING: This can really mess your eyes up. Do not use headphone until you get a feel for the gain levels and how the different waveforms play (HINT: square is loud as hell.)

# WHATS BROKE:
The oscillators  turn on when you adjust the gain level. I am working on this.
